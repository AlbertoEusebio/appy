# App-Y 😊

Appy is an app created for the honours project Intraprendenti at Politecnico di Torino.
The app aims at fight solitude and monotony by providing a way to socialize and make new friends.

## Why ❓
The project starts from the 80-years old research on Happiness carried out by Harvard University,
which proved that the key to an happy and long life are healthy and long-lasting relationships.
